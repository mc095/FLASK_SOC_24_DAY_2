    <h2>Cricket Game</h2>
    <p>
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that's played between two teams of 11 players on a field. 
        The game is played on an oval-shaped field with a 22-yard pitch at the center, and each end of
        the pitch has a wicket. The main objective of the game is to score as many runs as possible against the other team.
